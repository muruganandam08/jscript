The error "forbidden: user 'app:deployment' cannot create daemonsets" indicates that the user or service account you're using does not have the necessary permissions to create DaemonSets in your Kubernetes cluster. This is typically resolved by updating the role-based access control (RBAC) settings.

### Step-by-Step Solution

1. **Identify the Service Account**: Determine which service account is being used for the Helm deployment. This is often specified in the Helm chart values or in the Kubernetes context.

2. **Create a Role with DaemonSet Permissions**: Define a role that allows the creation of DaemonSets.

3. **Create a RoleBinding**: Bind the role to the service account.

### Example Steps

#### Step 1: Identify the Service Account

Check the service account specified in the Helm values file or the default service account in the namespace where you are deploying Jaeger.

#### Step 2: Create a Role with DaemonSet Permissions

Create a YAML file named `jaeger-daemonset-role.yaml`:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: jaeger-daemonset-role
  namespace: otel
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["daemonsets"]
  verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

Apply the role:

```sh
kubectl apply -f jaeger-daemonset-role.yaml
```

#### Step 3: Create a RoleBinding

Create a YAML file named `jaeger-daemonset-rolebinding.yaml` and replace `<service-account-name>` with the name of your service account:

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: jaeger-daemonset-rolebinding
  namespace: otel
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: <service-account-name>
  namespace: otel
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: jaeger-daemonset-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the role binding:

```sh
kubectl apply -f jaeger-daemonset-rolebinding.yaml
```

### Step 4: Retry the Deployment

Retry the Helm deployment:

```sh
helm install jaeger ./jaeger --namespace otel
```

### Full Example

Here is a full example with a service account named `jaeger-sa`:

#### jaeger-daemonset-role.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: Role
metadata:
  name: jaeger-daemonset-role
  namespace: otel
rules:
- apiGroups: ["apps"]
  resources: ["daemonsets"]
  verbs: ["create", "get", "list", "watch", "update", "patch", "delete"]
```

#### jaeger-daemonset-rolebinding.yaml

```yaml
apiVersion: rbac.authorization.k8s.io/v1
kind: RoleBinding
metadata:
  name: jaeger-daemonset-rolebinding
  namespace: otel
subjects:
- kind: ServiceAccount
  name: jaeger-sa
  namespace: otel
roleRef:
  kind: Role
  name: jaeger-daemonset-role
  apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
```

Apply the role and role binding:

```sh
kubectl apply -f jaeger-daemonset-role.yaml
kubectl apply -f jaeger-daemonset-rolebinding.yaml
```

Finally, ensure your Helm deployment uses the `jaeger-sa` service account:

```sh
helm install jaeger jaegertracing/jaeger --namespace otel --set serviceAccount.name=jaeger-sa
```

By following these steps, you should be able to resolve the permission issue and successfully deploy Jaeger with the necessary DaemonSet.

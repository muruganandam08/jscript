To update a quality profile rule manually in **SonarQube Enterprise Edition**, follow these steps:

### Step-by-Step Guide for Updating Quality Profile Rules

#### 1. **Log in to SonarQube**
   - Open your web browser and navigate to your SonarQube URL (e.g., `http://localhost:9000`).
   - Log in with your **SonarQube administrator** or **project administrator** credentials.

#### 2. **Access the Quality Profiles**
   - From the main dashboard, click on the **“Quality Profiles”** tab in the top navigation menu.
   - Here, you will see a list of quality profiles for different languages.

#### 3. **Select the Quality Profile to Update**
   - From the list of quality profiles, choose the one you want to update.
     - For example, if you want to update the **Java** quality profile, select the relevant Java profile (e.g., **Sonar way** or any custom profile).
   - Click on the profile name to view its details.

#### 4. **Update/Add New Rules**
   - Once inside the selected quality profile, you'll see options for managing the profile's rules.
   - To **add new rules**:
     - Click on the **“Activate More Rules”** button at the top.
     - You can filter rules by different criteria such as **language**, **status**, **tag**, or **repository**.
     - If you're specifically looking for **new rules**:
       - Filter by the **"New"** tag or status.
     - Select the rule(s) you want to add, then click **“Activate”**.

#### 5. **Deactivate Unwanted Rules**
   - To remove or deactivate unwanted rules:
     - In the quality profile's rule list, locate the rule you want to deactivate.
     - Click the **checkbox** next to the rule and click the **“Deactivate”** button.
     - The rule will be deactivated for that profile but will remain available globally.

#### 6. **Review and Apply Changes**
   - After making changes to the rules (adding, activating, or deactivating them), SonarQube will automatically save the updates to your quality profile.
   - You can now **re-scan your project** with the updated profile to ensure that the new rules are applied.

#### 7. **(Optional) Backup Quality Profile**
   - If you want to **export** the quality profile for backup or sharing with other SonarQube instances:
     - Click the **“Backup”** button in the profile details.
     - Save the profile as an XML file for future use.

### Tips:
- Ensure that the profile you're updating is the one being used by your project. You can check or change the assigned profile in the **project settings**.
- If you're updating rules across multiple profiles, repeat the process for each language or custom profile.
- Periodically check for new rules or updated rules from SonarQube to keep your profile up to date.

By following these steps, you can manually update the rules in your SonarQube quality profile.
